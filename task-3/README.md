# Task 3

## Subtask (a)

The code is available in the pdf2mongo.py file. It requires that an instance of mongoDB running on localhost on port 27017 (the default port).

To run the file:

```bash
python pdf2mongo.py <filepath>
```

I tried a couple of different libraries like camelot, tabula, etc but in the end it seems that tabula seems to give the best results. It must be noted that even tabula is not perfect and results and there is certainly a room for improvement.

## Subtask (b)

The code is available in the file: xml2mongo.py. It has the same requirement for mongodb as the previous subtask. It also needs the zip file provided to be extracted in the same folder. This means that stackoverflow.com folder  and the python file must be in the same parent directory.
